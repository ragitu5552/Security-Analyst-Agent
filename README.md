# 🚀 Drone Security Analyst Agent

## 🌟 Overview

This project brings to life a **Drone Security Analyst Agent** 🛸 that processes simulated drone telemetry and video frames to **detect and analyze security events**. The agent identifies objects and activities, logs them 📜, and generates **real-time security alerts 🚨** based on predefined rules.

## 🔥 Features

✅ Processes simulated drone telemetry data and video frames 🎥📡  
✅ Analyzes video content to identify objects and events 🕵️‍♂️  
✅ Logs identified objects and events with context 📝  
✅ Generates real-time security/safety alerts based on predefined rules ⚠️  
✅ Includes a basic frame-by-frame indexing system 🗂️

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of:

- **📡 Data Generation:** Simulated video frames and telemetry.
- **🎯 Frame Processing:** Detects objects and actions using an **LLM**.
- **📝 Logging Mechanism:** Stores events in a database.
- **🚨 Alert System:** Triggers alerts based on predefined rules and contextual analysis.
- **🔍 Query System:** Retrieves stored events.

## 💡 Design Decisions

- **🐍 Python** was chosen for its rich ecosystem and ease of use.
- **🤖 LangChain + Groq's LLM** for object detection and contextual analysis.
- **💾 SQLite** as the database for simplicity.
- **⚖️ Hybrid Alert System** combining rule-based and contextual analysis.

## 🛠️ AI Tools Integration

- **LangChain** → Structures LLM output and creates prompts ✍️  
- **Groq's LLM** → Handles object detection and contextual analysis 🧠  
- **dotenv** → Manages API keys securely 🔑  

These tools **accelerate development 🚀** by simplifying LLM integration!

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1️⃣ Environment Setup

- Install Python 3.x 🐍
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Set up your **Groq API key**:

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 2️⃣ Database Initialization

- The database `security.db` is automatically created when `logs.py` is executed. 🗃️

### 3️⃣ Running the Scripts

- **Generate sample data and process frames:**

```bash
python logs.py
```

- **Run the query system:**

```bash
python query.py
```

## 📜 Scripts Breakdown

- **`data.py`** → Generates simulated video frame & telemetry data 🎥📊  
- **`logs.py`** → Processes frames, logs events, and generates alerts 🚨  
- **`query.py`** → Implements the security query system 🔍

## ✅ Test Cases

🔹 **Object Detection** → Ensures objects are identified and logged correctly 🏷️  
🔹 **Alert Generation** → Triggers alerts for security threats (e.g., "Masked man detected" 😨)  
🔹 **Contextual Analysis** → Detects anomalies (e.g., **loitering detection** 🕵️‍♀️)  
🔹 **Database Queries** → Validates event retrieval by **time, object, and location** 📍

## 🧐 Assumptions

- Simulated data is used for video frames and telemetry 🎭  
- The drone's position is fixed 📍  
- Object detection relies on **text-based descriptions** 📜

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

✨ **Real-time video processing** 📹  
✨ **Advanced object tracking** 🎯  
✨ **Smarter query system** 🔍  
✨ **Video summarization feature** 🎞️  
✨ **User-friendly interface for the agent** 🖥️

## 🤖 AI Assistance

- **Claude Code** was used for initial coding suggestions.  
- **LLMs** helped generate object descriptions and analyze context.
